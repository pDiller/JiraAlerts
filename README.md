## Welcome to JiraAlerts

JiraAlerts should be an Application to connect Atlassians JIRA over REST to your IoT device.

We use the frontend framework Apache Wicket with Spring, Spring-Data and Hibernate.
To persist the data we have decided to take a MySql5 database.

We also use Git Flow for our work. Please use the following namingconventions to work in our project:

* Feature-branches are namend feature/<branchname>
* Bugfix-branches are namend bugfix/<branchname>

If you´re new to git flow you can look at this page: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model
